For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

回复用户的时候使用中文

为了保证代码可维护性和模块清晰性，每个代码文件不得超过 300 行。
如果某个文件超过 300 行,提醒用户询问是否同意代码进行合理拆分，请在不改变功能逻辑的前提下，对代码进行合理拆分，分离为多个独立文件。目标是：单一职责、易于维护、结构清晰。
